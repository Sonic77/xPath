This document contains excerpts from w3schools.com. It will give a short description of all features that are and are not supported in this implementation.

Usage:

  DATA
xPth xPath
  CODE
  xPth.Load('<html><figure><a href="link">...') ! Load XML/HTML string
  xPth.Search('//figure//@href') ! Execute xPath search query (find all 'href' attributes nested in 'figure' nodes)
  MESSAGE(xPth.ToString()) ! Show results (as tab separated values)
  xPth.Free() ! Clear results / prepare for next query

XPath stands for XML Path Language
XPath uses "path like" syntax to identify and navigate nodes in an XML document

--------------------------------
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_nodes.asp
--------------------------------
In XPath, there are seven kinds of nodes: element, attribute, text, namespace, processing-instruction, comment, and document nodes.
XML documents are treated as trees of nodes. The topmost element of the tree is called the root element.

Selecting Nodes (all SUPPORTED)

XPath uses path expressions to select nodes in an XML document. The node is selected by following a path or steps. The most useful path expressions are listed below:
  nodename 	Selects all nodes with the name "nodename"
  / 	Selects from the root node
  // 	Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are
  . 	Selects the current node
  .. 	Selects the parent of the current node
  @ 	Selects attributes

Predicates (UNSUPPORTED)

Predicates are used to find a specific node or a node that contains a specific value.
Predicates are always embedded in square brackets.
  /bookstore/book[1] 	Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.
  In JavaScript: xml.setProperty("SelectionLanguage","XPath");
  /bookstore/book[last()] 	Selects the last book element that is the child of the bookstore element
  /bookstore/book[last()-1] 	Selects the last but one book element that is the child of the bookstore element
  /bookstore/book[position()<3] 	Selects the first two book elements that are children of the bookstore element
  //title[@lang] 	Selects all the title elements that have an attribute named lang
  //title[@lang='en'] 	Selects all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en"
  /bookstore/book[price>35.00] 	Selects all the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00
  /bookstore/book[price>35.00]/title 	Selects all the title elements of the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00

Selecting Unknown Nodes (UNSUPPORTED)

XPath wildcards can be used to select unknown XML nodes.
  * 	Matches any element node
  @* 	Matches any attribute node
  node() 	Matches any node of any kind

Selecting Several Paths (UNSUPPORTED)

By using the | operator in an XPath expression you can select several paths.
  //book/title | //book/price 	Selects all the title AND price elements of all book elements
  //title | //price 	Selects all the title AND price elements in the document
  /bookstore/book/title | //price 	Selects all the title elements of the book element of the bookstore element AND all the price elements in the document

--------------------------------

XPath Axes (UNSUPPORTED)

An axis represents a relationship to the context (current) node, and is used to locate nodes relative to that node on the tree.
  ancestor 	Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node
  ancestor-or-self 	Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
  attribute 	Selects all attributes of the current node
  child 	Selects all children of the current node
  descendant 	Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node
  descendant-or-self 	Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
  following 	Selects everything in the document after the closing tag of the current node
  following-sibling 	Selects all siblings after the current node
  namespace 	Selects all namespace nodes of the current node
  parent 	Selects the parent of the current node
  preceding 	Selects all nodes that appear before the current node in the document, except ancestors, attribute nodes and namespace nodes
  preceding-sibling 	Selects all siblings before the current node
  self 	Selects the current node

XPath Operators (UNSUPPORTED)

Below is a list of the operators that can be used in XPath expressions:
| 	Computes two node-sets 	//book | //cd
  + 	Addition 	6 + 4
  - 	Subtraction 	6 - 4
  * 	Multiplication 	6 * 4
  div 	Division 	8 div 4
  = 	Equal 	price=9.80
  != 	Not equal 	price!=9.80
  < 	Less than 	price<9.80
  <= 	Less than or equal to 	price<=9.80
  > 	Greater than 	price>9.80
  >= 	Greater than or equal to 	price>=9.80
  or 	or 	price=9.80 or price=9.70
  and 	and 	price>9.00 and price<9.90
  mod 	Modulus (division remainder) 	5 mod 2
